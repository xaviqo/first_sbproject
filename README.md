Client Manager - My first Spring Boot API
=
This project it's not made to solve any specific need apart from learning how to apply different technologies.

## Used technologies

- Maven (To manage dependencies)
- Lombok (For the Getters and Setters)
- Hibernate (Java ORM for the Database)
- Argon2 (Cryptographic algorithm for hashing the passwords)
- Data-tables (Javascript library to list the clients)
- JWT (Standardized JSON based token)

## Available features

- Register
- Login
- List registered users

## Images

> Password is encripted with Argon2 and saved in the DB to avoid anyone to know your password, even the system administrador.
